# U.S. Medical Insurance Project
_Check out the project file in the main branch!_

This is a practice project that defines functions and classes to organize and load data.
A function is defined and used to load the data, and a class is constructed to create a dictionary.
Once data is loaded in, it is time to analyze the data!
This data is composed of 1338 entries of medical insurance information inluding patient info: age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.
By the end we look at the correlation between BMI and insurance cost to find a Pearson correlation of 0.765. This is a significant correlation!
